# Hiring prediction on unbalanced data

The topic is hiring prediction, from data representating job's applications. 
The dataset represents the job's
 applications and the features are: 

  * date: date of application, 
  * hair: color of hair, 
  * age, 
  * experience: number of years of experience, 
  * salary: salary expectation, 
  * gender, 
  * diploma, 
  * speciality, 
  * note: technical test note, 
  * availability, 
  * hiring: target variable.

The goal is to predict the hiring variable which is either 'yes' or 'no'.
Consequently the problem is turned into a **binary classification** task.
Moreover, the data are not correlated and **unbalanced**.
